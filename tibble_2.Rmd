```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

## Step 2

Go from `tibble_1` in `tibble_2`. Don't worry about the raw files. Start with what you have in `tibble_1`, which can be read in using `read_rds()`. Produce a tibble with the same variables/ordering as `tibble_2`.

```{r}
tibble_1_read <- read_rds('tibble_1.rds')
```
